## Roadmap

1. **Enhanced Template Customisation:** Allow users to customise the generated README template with additional sections or personalised formatting options.

2. **Integration with Version Control:** Implement features to automatically update and commit the generated README file to the project's version control system (e.g., Git), streamlining project documentation management.

3. **Template Presets and Themes:** Introduce pre-defined README templates or themes tailored for specific project types (e.g., Node.js package, Python library), offering users a selection of templates optimised for their project needs.

4. **Advanced Configuration Options:** Provide advanced configuration settings to control the behaviour of the README generation process, such as choosing different licence types, specifying testing frameworks, or including badges for project status and metrics.

5. **Interactive Preview Mode:** Introduce an interactive preview mode where users can see a live preview of their README as they input project details, enabling real-time feedback and adjustments before finalising the generation process.
